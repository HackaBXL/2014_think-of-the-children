2014 Hackathon : think-of-the-children
==========================

The purpose of this project is to cross population density and schools capacity in order to identify
weak spots where children infrastructures are missing.

The result will computed by municipality and shown on a map.

If possible we will do the following:

* extrapolate the evolution of the population to identify potential future problems

## Used datasets

- mapping zip code : nis code
- municipalities geometry by nis code
- population by age group by post code
- number of children per school (VGC)
- number of children in school per municipality
